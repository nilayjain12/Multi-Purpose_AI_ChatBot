# Multi-Purpose_AI_ChatBot
To create a multipurpose AI chatbot using LLMs and LangChain with Vector DB.

**This chatbot app is based on the famous Harry Potter novels that could be able to answer any question asked by the user in a well-structured way.**

In this application, I'm trying different open-source hugging face transformers. I'm using two different strategies: 1) Applying the **Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)** technique to get the precise context for the LLM, and 2) **Fine-tuning** some small-scale hugging face transformers on the novel to understand the semantic meaning and answer appropriately.
